// ****DATA****
// Data is a collection of a distinct small unit of information.It can be used in a variety of forms like text,
// numbers, media, bytes, etc.it can be stored in pieces of paper or electronic memory, etc.

// ****DATABASE****
// A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed.

// ****DATABASE HANDLER****
// Database handlers create a database in such a way that only one set of software program provides access of data to all the users.
// The main purpose of the database is to operate a large amount of information by storing, retrieving, and managing data.

// There are many databases available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, MongoDB, Informix, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.\

// Modern databases are managed by the database management system (DBMS).

// ****SQL****
// SQL or Structured Query Language is used to operate on the data stored in a database. SQL depends on
// relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.
// A cylindrical structure is used to display the image of a database.
// The first internet database application had been created in 1995.

// ****Relational Database****
// 1970 - Present: It is the era of Relational Database and Database Management. In 1970, the relational model was proposed by 
// E.F. Codd.
// Relational database model has two main terminologies called instance and schema.
// The instance is a table with rows or columns
// Schema specifies the structure like name of the relation, type of each column and name.
// This model uses some mathematical concept like set theory and predicate logic.
// The first internet database application had been created in 1995.
// During the era of the relational database,many more models had introduced like object-oriented model,object-relational model,etc.

// ****Cloud database****
// Cloud database facilitates you to store, manage, and retrieve their structured, unstructured data via a cloud platform.
// This data is accessible over the Internet.Cloud databases are also called a database as service (DBaaS) because they are offered 
// as a managed service.
// Some best cloud options are:
// AWS (Amazon Web Services)
// Snowflake Computing
// Oracle Database Cloud Services
// Microsoft SQL server
// Google cloud spanner

// **Advantages of cloud database
// Lower costs
// Generally, company provider does not have to invest in databases. It can maintain and support one or more data centers.
// Automated
// Cloud databases are enriched with a variety of automated processes such as recovery, failover, and auto-scaling.
// Increased accessibility
// You can access your cloud-based database from any location, anytime. All you need is just an internet connection.





// ****NoSQL Database****
// A NoSQL database is an approach to design such databases that can accommodate a wide variety of data models. NoSQL stands for
// "not only SQL." It is an alternative to traditional relational databases in which data is placed in tables, and data schema 
// is perfectly designed before the database is built.
// NoSQL databases are useful for a large set of distributed data.
// Some examples of NoSQL database system with their category are:
// MongoDB, CouchDB, Cloudant (Document-based)
// Memcached, Redis, Coherence (key-value store)
// HBase, Big Table, Accumulo (Tabular)

// **Advantage of NoSQL
// High Scalability
// NoSQL can handle an extensive amount of data because of scalability. If the data grows, NoSQL database scale it to handle 
// that data in an efficient manner.
// High Availability
// NoSQL supports auto replication. Auto replication makes it highly available because, in case of any failure, data 
// replicates itself to the previous consistent state.


// **Disadvantage of NoSQL
// Open source
// NoSQL is an open-source database, so there is no reliable standard for NoSQL yet.
// Management challenge
// Data management in NoSQL is much more complicated than relational databases. It is very challenging to install 
// and even more hectic to manage daily.
// GUI is not available
// GUI tools for NoSQL database are not easily available in the market.
// Backup
// Backup is a great weak point for NoSQL databases. Some databases, like MongoDB, have no powerful approaches for data backup.
